                  Centered around topics like compact disks, e-books, and fractal
                  mapping of coastlines, TED (Technology, Entertainment, and Design)
                  has evolved into a global beacon of creativity and intellect.
                  Initially featuring a narrow range of panelists, TED gradually
                  broadened its scope to include business magnates, scientists, and
                  philosophers. TED's influence extends beyond its flagship event,
                  spawning a diverse array of sister initiatives such as TED-Ed
                  educating people through engaging animations, TEDGlobal, a
                  traveling conference held in various locales, and the TED Prize,
                  offering recipients the opportunity to catalyze positive change.
                  TED has since embraced inclusivity, welcoming all into its fold
                  and continually inspiring progress.

                  TEDx is an initiative to promote 'ideas worth spreading' in local
                  communities across the world. Steered by passionate individuals,
                  TEDx events aim to infuse the spirit of TED at the grassroot level
                  through a series of independently organised events. These events are
                  aimed at bringing new ideas and stories to the society so as to
                  inspire and spark meaningful conversations. These events, under the
                  umbrella of TED, adhere to set of prescribed guidelines provided
                  alongwith the license. More than 3000 events are held as part of
                  TEDx each year.

                  With a motto, “Arise, awake & stop not till the goal is achieved”,
                  SGVS has taken it as a challenge to imbibe in students right values,
                  awareness of their strengths and weakness, to make them able to
                  think creatively, to become techno savvy and showcase their hidden
                  talent, also to develop a spirit of camaraderie and competitiveness.
                  One can witness its orchestration with superb precision by
                  highlighting its unique design based on new concepts and ideas; it
                  is all set to deliver a value proposition which exceeds everyone's
                  expectation.
